	<h3><a name="estate" class="practice">Estate Planning</a></h3>
	<p>Everyone should have a will and powers of attorney. Effective estate planning ensures that you can specify who you want to act on your behalf, that your assets will be passed on to your loved ones or others as you wish, and that your planning can avoid unnecessary tax or financial consequences. As an experienced estate planning attorney, Rick Drews will meet with you and listen to your needs and wishes to prepare a customized estate plan for your particular situation.</p>

	<p>Rick also provides legal representation in the administration of estates, whether in probate court or not, and has represented those acting as personal representative, executor, guardian, conservator and/or trustee to protect the interests of those acting on behalf of an estate or another person. He has worked closely with accountants, insurance professionals and retirement account administrators in the preparation of estate plans and the administration of estates to meet the needs of each situation.</p>
